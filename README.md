**Some of the key features of the Sales dashboard include:-**

* Total sales throughout business, Unique Customers who ordered, Total Products available In the data, Number of orders made by customers.

*  Used Filters to check the data based on Region, city, Sub-category, Product name, Customer name and Ship mode etc. Also I have used a date range slicer for report level to check the data in the particular period of time.
